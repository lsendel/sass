## 🏗️ Architecture

### CI Pipeline (`ci-main.yml`)
```
Constitutional Compliance ──┐
Security Scanning ─────────┼─→ Backend Tests ─→ Build & Package
                           └─→ Quality Gates ─→ Docker Image
```

### CD Pipeline (`cd-deploy.yml`)
```
CI Success ─→ Staging Deploy ─→ Smoke Tests ─→ Production Blue-Green ─→ Release
```
