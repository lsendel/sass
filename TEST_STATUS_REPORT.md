# Test Status Report

## Current Status: ❌ COMPILATION ERRORS

### Issues Identified:

#### 1. **Compilation Errors** (Critical)
- Missing imports in `SubscriptionManagementServiceImpl.java`
- Missing imports in `OrganizationManagementServiceImpl.java` 
- Type mismatches in `PasswordAuthService.java`
- Missing method calls in `PasswordAuthController.java`

#### 2. **Test Failures** (35/58 tests failing)
- Architecture tests failing due to module boundary violations
- Integration tests failing due to Spring context issues
- Unit tests failing due to compilation errors

### Immediate Actions Required:

#### Fix Compilation (Priority 1)
```bash
# Add missing imports
# Fix type mismatches
# Resolve method signature issues
```

#### Fix Test Configuration (Priority 2)
```bash
# Update application-test.properties
# Fix Spring context loading
# Resolve dependency injection issues
```

### Quick Verification Commands:

```bash
# Check compilation
cd backend && ./gradlew compileJava

# Run minimal tests (after compilation fixes)
cd backend && ./gradlew test --tests "*UnitTest*"

# Full test suite (final verification)
cd backend && ./gradlew test
```

### Status Summary:
- ❌ **Compilation**: FAILING (multiple errors)
- ❌ **Unit Tests**: Cannot run due to compilation
- ❌ **Integration Tests**: Cannot run due to compilation  
- ❌ **Architecture Tests**: Failing due to violations

### Next Steps:
1. Fix compilation errors first
2. Run unit tests to verify basic functionality
3. Fix integration test configuration
4. Address architecture violations
5. Verify all tests pass

**Estimated Time to Fix**: 30-60 minutes for compilation + test fixes
