# SASS Project Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary
This plan addresses critical issues and optimization opportunities in the SASS payment platform to improve code quality, test reliability, and development efficiency.

## Critical Issues (Priority 1) üö®

### 1. Test Suite Stabilization
**Problem:** 34/58 backend tests failing, 16 frontend test files failing
**Impact:** Blocks CI/CD, reduces confidence in deployments
**Solution:**
```bash
# Fix backend tests
cd backend && ./gradlew test --continue --info > test-failures.log 2>&1
# Analyze and fix failing tests systematically
```

### 2. Code Coverage Improvement
**Problem:** Coverage below 85% target
**Impact:** Quality gates failing, potential bugs in production
**Solution:**
- Add missing unit tests for core business logic
- Improve integration test coverage
- Remove dead code

### 3. Dependency Updates
**Problem:** Some dependencies may be outdated
**Impact:** Security vulnerabilities, missing features
**Solution:**
- Update Spring Boot to latest stable (3.5.x)
- Update React to latest stable (19.x)
- Update testing frameworks

## High-Impact Improvements (Priority 2) ‚ö°

### 4. Performance Optimization
**Backend:**
- Add database connection pooling optimization
- Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Add API response compression

**Frontend:**
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Add service worker for caching
- Optimize bundle size

### 5. Developer Experience Enhancement
**Build System:**
- Parallel test execution
- Incremental builds
- Hot reload improvements

**Tooling:**
- Enhanced Makefile with better error handling
- Improved local development setup
- Better debugging tools

### 6. Security Hardening
- Implement rate limiting
- Add request validation middleware
- Enhance CORS configuration
- Add security headers

## Architecture Improvements (Priority 3) üèóÔ∏è

### 7. Modularity Enhancement
- Strengthen module boundaries
- Implement event-driven communication
- Add module-specific configuration

### 8. Observability
- Enhanced logging with structured format
- Distributed tracing
- Better metrics collection
- Health check improvements

### 9. Documentation
- API documentation with OpenAPI 3.0
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Developer onboarding guide
- Deployment runbooks
