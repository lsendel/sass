# ADR-001: Spring Modulith Architecture for RBAC System

## Status
**ACCEPTED** - 2024-01-15

## Context

The RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system needs to be implemented as part of a larger Spring Boot Modulith payment platform. The system must provide secure, performant, and maintainable access control while maintaining proper module boundaries and enabling cross-module integration.

## Decision

We will implement the RBAC system using **Spring Modulith architecture principles** with the following structure:

### Module Package Structure
```
com.platform.user/
├── api/                    # Public interfaces for external module access
├── internal/               # Implementation details (hidden from other modules)
└── events/                # Event definitions for inter-module communication
```

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Public API Contracts**: External modules can only access functionality through defined API interfaces
2. **Internal Isolation**: All implementation details are hidden in the `internal/` package
3. **Event-Driven Integration**: Cross-module communication happens through published events
4. **Module Boundary Enforcement**: ArchUnit tests validate architectural compliance

## Rationale

### Benefits of Spring Modulith Architecture

1. **Clear Module Boundaries**: Prevents tight coupling between modules
2. **Maintainability**: Changes to internal implementations don't affect other modules
3. **Testability**: Each module can be tested in isolation
4. **Scalability**: Modules can potentially be extracted to separate services later
5. **Team Autonomy**: Different teams can own different modules independently

### Alternative Approaches Considered

#### Traditional Layered Architecture
- **Rejected**: Would allow direct access to internal classes across packages
- **Issue**: No enforcement of module boundaries
- **Impact**: Higher coupling and harder to maintain

#### Microservices Architecture
- **Rejected**: Too complex for current scale and requirements
- **Issue**: Network latency would violate <200ms performance requirements
- **Impact**: Increased operational complexity

#### Monolithic Package Structure
- **Rejected**: Would create tight coupling between components
- **Issue**: Difficult to maintain and test
- **Impact**: Reduced code quality and team productivity

## Implementation Details

### API Interfaces
- `PermissionApi`: Core permission checking and validation
- `RoleApi`: Role information and management operations
- `UserRoleApi`: User role assignment operations

### Event Publishing
- All role and permission changes publish events for cross-module integration
- Events include correlation IDs for tracing
- Async event processing to avoid blocking operations

### Architecture Validation
- ArchUnit tests enforce module boundaries
- Automated validation in CI/CD pipeline
- Prevents accidental boundary violations

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Strong Encapsulation**: Internal changes don't affect other modules
- **Clear Contracts**: Well-defined APIs for external consumption
- **Event-Driven Integration**: Loose coupling between modules
- **Future-Proof**: Can migrate to microservices if needed

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand Modulith principles
- **Initial Complexity**: More interfaces and boundaries to maintain
- **Event Complexity**: Need to handle eventual consistency

### Mitigations
- Comprehensive documentation and training
- Clear examples and patterns
- Architecture tests to catch violations early
- Event monitoring and debugging tools

## Compliance

This decision aligns with:
- **Constitutional Principle**: Modular architecture requirements
- **Performance Requirements**: <200ms response times maintained
- **Security Requirements**: Clear security boundaries
- **Maintainability Requirements**: Testable and maintainable code
