# Security Policy

## Security First Approach

The SASS (Spring Boot Application with Security System) project follows a "security first" approach in all development practices. Security is considered at every stage of the development lifecycle, from design to deployment.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | Notes              |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| 1.x     | ✅ Yes             | Actively maintained |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              | Not supported       |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Private Disclosure Process

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and request that you report them responsibly:

1. **Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues**
2. **Contact us directly**: Send details to [security contact email] or create a private security advisory in this repository
3. **Include the following information**:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Location/affected components
   - Reproduction steps
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- Acknowledgment within 48 hours
- Regular updates on the investigation status
- Notification when the vulnerability is addressed
- Credit for responsible disclosure (if desired)

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

- Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Use secure session management
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
- Regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities

### For Users

- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication where available
- Keep your software updated
- Review and audit permissions regularly
- Monitor for suspicious activities

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- OAuth2 with multiple provider support (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Session-based authentication with secure token handling
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Account lockout mechanisms

### Data Protection

- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- PCI DSS compliance for payment processing
- GDPR compliance for data handling
- Regular security audits

### API Security

- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication required for all sensitive endpoints
- Audit logging for all operations
- API versioning for security updates

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Checks

- Static Application Security Testing (SAST) integrated in CI/CD
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- OWASP ZAP dynamic security testing
- Automated penetration testing for critical paths

### Security Test Coverage

- Authentication flow testing
- Authorization bypass attempts
- SQL injection and XSS prevention
- CSRF protection validation
- Session management testing

## Compliance

### Standards

- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- PCI DSS compliance for payment processing
- GDPR compliance for data handling
- SOC 2 compliance (planned)

### Certifications

- Regular third-party security audits
- Penetration testing by certified security firms
- Code reviews by security experts

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth

1. **Network Layer**: Firewall rules and network segmentation
2. **Application Layer**: Input validation, authentication, authorization
3. **Data Layer**: Encryption, access controls, audit logging
4. **Infrastructure**: Container security, runtime protection

### Monitoring & Detection

- Real-time threat detection
- Anomaly detection for unusual access patterns
- Security event logging and analysis
- Automated incident response

## Incident Response

### Response Team

Our security team follows a defined incident response process:

1. **Detection & Analysis**: Identify and analyze security incidents
2. **Containment & Eradication**: Contain and eliminate threats
3. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
4. **Post-Incident Activity**: Analyze and improve processes

### Communication Plan

- Internal team notification within 1 hour
- Customer notification within 24 hours (if affected)
- Public disclosure within 72 hours (if required)

## Dependencies Security

### Vulnerability Management

- Regular dependency updates and patching
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation
- Vulnerability scanning with tools like OWASP Dependency Check
- Automated alerts for known vulnerabilities

### Supply Chain Security

- Signed artifacts verification
- Trusted source verification for dependencies
- Regular review of third-party components

## Audit & Compliance

### Regular Audits

- Quarterly internal security audits
- Annual third-party security assessments
- Continuous monitoring of security metrics
- Regular penetration testing

### Compliance Reporting

- SOC 2 Type II compliance (ongoing)
- PCI DSS compliance reports
- GDPR compliance documentation
- Security metrics reporting
