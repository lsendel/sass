# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Analyze and understand the Spring Boot Modulith Payment Platform with React frontend to document its architecture, features, and development workflows.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Spring Boot 3.5.5 (Java 21) with Modulith architecture on backend, React 18+ with TypeScript on frontend
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose with PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx, Prometheus, Grafana
- **Authentication**: Dual OAuth2 (Google/GitHub/Microsoft) and password-based authentication with multi-tenant organization context
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration for subscriptions and payments
- **Development Tools**: Makefile for common commands, Gradle for backend, npm for frontend
- **Testing**: JUnit/Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests
- **Key Modules**: Auth, User, Payment, Subscription, and Shared components in backend; modular Redux store in frontend

## Recent Actions
- Analyzed project structure and configuration files (.env, docker-compose)
- Examined backend Spring Boot application with modular architecture
- Reviewed frontend React application with Redux Toolkit state management
- Studied authentication implementation including OAuth2 and password-based flows
- Reviewed deployment scripts and production configuration
- Documented core features and technology stack
