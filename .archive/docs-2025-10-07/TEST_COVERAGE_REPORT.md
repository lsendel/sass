## 🚀 Performance Impact

### **Test Execution Speed**

- **Total test time**: ~1.36 seconds for 107 tests
- **Average per test**: ~13ms per test
- **Coverage generation**: Additional ~500ms
- **CI/CD ready**: Fast enough for continuous integration

### **Bundle Size Impact**

- **Zero production impact** - tests excluded from builds
- **Development only** - test utilities properly tree-shaken
- **Coverage instrumentation** - Only enabled when needed

---

## 🔄 Continuous Integration Setup

### **Pre-commit Hooks**

```bash
# Recommended pre-commit configuration
npm run test:coverage:check  # Enforce coverage before commit
npm run lint                 # Code quality check
npm run typecheck           # TypeScript validation
```

### **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions integration
- name: Run Tests with Coverage
  run: npm run test:coverage:check
- name: Upload Coverage Reports
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```
