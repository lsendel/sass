## üîß Core Action Wiring Improvements

### **Form Validation Enhancements**

```typescript
// ENHANCED FORM VALIDATION PATTERN
Add real-time validation to [All Forms]:
- Email: valid format - show "Please enter a valid email" below field
- Password: 12+ chars, complexity - show strength meter with requirements
- Organization name: 3-50 chars, unique - show "Name already taken" or green checkmark
- Mark required fields with red asterisk
- Disable submit until all validations pass
- On blur, check each field and show tick/cross icon
Keep error messages under 10 words and actionable.
```

### **Loading State Standardization**

```typescript
// UNIVERSAL LOADING STATES
For all async actions, implement consistent loading UX:
- Button states: disable + show "Processing..." text
- Form states: disable all inputs + overlay spinner
- Page states: skeleton screens for initial loads
- List states: preserve existing items + loading indicator for new data
- Modal states: prevent closing during operations
```

### **Error Handling Improvements**

```typescript
// ENHANCED ERROR HANDLING
For all API failures, implement comprehensive error UX:
- Network errors: "Connection lost. Retrying in 3 seconds..." with countdown
- Validation errors: inline field-specific messages
- Permission errors: "You don't have permission for this action"
- Rate limiting: "Too many requests. Please wait X seconds."
- Generic errors: "Something went wrong. Please try again." with error code
All errors include retry functionality and clear recovery paths.
```

## üìà Performance & UX Optimization Prompts

### **Data Management**

```typescript
// AUTO-SAVE IMPLEMENTATION
On [All Forms], implement auto-save:
- Save after 2 seconds of no typing
- Show "Saving..." then "Saved at [time]" near form title
- If save fails, show "Unable to save" with retry button
- Indicate unsaved changes with orange dot indicator
- Prevent navigation with unsaved changes

// OPTIMISTIC UPDATES
For critical user actions, implement optimistic updates:
- Payment method changes: update UI immediately, revert on failure
- Organization updates: show changes instantly, sync with server
- Status changes: reflect immediately, show loading state in background
```

### **Search & Filter Enhancements**

```typescript
// ADVANCED SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY
Implement comprehensive search across all list views:
- Debounced search (300ms delay) to prevent excessive API calls
- Search suggestions based on recent searches
- Advanced filters: date ranges, status, amount ranges
- Saved search preferences per user
- Search result highlighting with matched terms
```

### **Navigation & Flow Improvements**

```typescript
// BREADCRUMB NAVIGATION
Add breadcrumb navigation to all detail pages:
- Dashboard > Organizations > [Org Name] > Settings
- Clickable breadcrumb segments for easy navigation
- Show current page context
- Include back button for mobile views

// MULTI-STEP PROCESS NAVIGATION
For complex workflows, add progress indicators:
- Visual step indicators (1 of 3, 2 of 3, etc.)
- Save progress at each step
- Allow navigation between completed steps
- Clear indication of current step and completion status
```
