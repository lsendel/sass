# Feature Specification: Complete UI Documentation for Project Management & Collaboration Platform

**Feature Branch**: `015-complete-ui-documentation`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Complete UI Documentation: Project Management & Collaboration Platform - A web-based project management and collaboration platform designed to help teams organize work, track progress, and communicate effectively. The application enables users to create projects, manage tasks, collaborate with team members, and monitor project health through dashboards and reporting."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature involves comprehensive project management platform
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: project managers, team members, stakeholders
   ’ Actions: create projects, manage tasks, collaborate, track progress
   ’ Data: projects, tasks, team members, activity logs, files
   ’ Constraints: team sizes (5-50 people), real-time collaboration
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Authentication method not specified
   ’ Integration requirements unclear
   ’ Performance targets undefined
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flows identified for core functionality
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (project, task, user, team, workspace)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Multiple [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] items require attention
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a project manager, I want to create and manage projects with my team so that we can track progress, collaborate on tasks, and deliver work efficiently. Team members should be able to view their assigned tasks, update progress, collaborate through comments, and access shared project files from any device.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a new user, **When** I sign up and create my first workspace, **Then** I should be guided through setting up my first project with sample data
2. **Given** I am a project manager, **When** I create a new project, **Then** I should be able to add team members, set up task boards, and define project timeline
3. **Given** I am a team member, **When** I log into the platform, **Then** I should see my assigned tasks for today and be able to update their status
4. **Given** I am working on a task, **When** I drag it from "In Progress" to "Review", **Then** the change should be immediately visible to all team members viewing the project
5. **Given** I am viewing a task, **When** I add a comment or attachment, **Then** other team members should receive notifications and see the updates in real-time
6. **Given** I am a team member, **When** I search for content across projects, **Then** I should find relevant results from projects I have access to
7. **Given** I am offline, **When** I make changes to tasks, **Then** my changes should be queued and synchronized when I reconnect

### Edge Cases
- What happens when multiple users edit the same task simultaneously?
- How does the system handle file uploads that exceed size limits?
- What occurs when a user loses internet connection during critical operations?
- How are users notified when they lose access to a project?
- What happens when workspace storage limits are reached?
- How does the system handle users trying to access deleted or archived content?
