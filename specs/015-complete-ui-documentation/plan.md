# Implementation Plan: Complete UI Documentation for Project Management & Collaboration Platform


**Branch**: `015-complete-ui-documentation` | **Date**: 2025-09-28 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/015-complete-ui-documentation/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
A comprehensive web-based project management and collaboration platform enabling teams of 5-50 people to organize work, track progress, and collaborate effectively. The platform includes project creation, task management with drag-and-drop boards, real-time collaboration features, file sharing, search capabilities, personalized dashboards, and mobile-responsive interfaces. Key features include workspace management, team collaboration tools, calendar views, activity feeds, and extensive permission controls.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Java 21 (backend), React 18+ with TypeScript (frontend)
**Primary Dependencies**: Spring Boot 3.5.5, Spring Security, PostgreSQL, Redis, WebSocket, React, Redux Toolkit
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (primary data), Redis (caching, sessions), File storage (attachments)
**Testing**: JUnit 5, Testcontainers (backend), Vitest, Playwright (frontend)
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge), mobile-responsive
**Project Type**: web - determines source structure
**Performance Goals**: Dashboard load <2s, real-time updates <1s, handle 100+ concurrent users
**Constraints**: Offline capability, mobile-responsive, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), real-time collaboration
**Scale/Scope**: 5-50 users per workspace, multiple projects per workspace, extensive permission system

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: [#] (max 3 - e.g., api, cli, tests)
- Using framework directly? (no wrapper classes)
- Single data model? (no DTOs unless serialization differs)
- Avoiding patterns? (no Repository/UoW without proven need)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? (no direct app code)
- Libraries listed: [name + purpose for each]
- CLI per library: [commands with --help/--version/--format]
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned?

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? (test MUST fail first)
- Git commits show tests before implementation?
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed?
- Real dependencies used? (actual DBs, not mocks)
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas?
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included?
- Frontend logs → backend? (unified stream)
- Error context sufficient?

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? (MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD)
- BUILD increments on every change?
- Breaking changes handled? (parallel tests, migration plan)

**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web application (frontend + backend architecture required)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base structure
- Extract tasks from Phase 1 deliverables:
  - API contracts (18 endpoints) → Contract test tasks (18 tasks) [P]
  - Data model (10 entities) → Entity model tasks (10 tasks) [P]
  - Quickstart scenarios (7 scenarios) → Integration test tasks (7 tasks)
  - UI components (dashboard, projects, tasks, mobile) → Component implementation tasks (15 tasks)
  - Authentication & security → Security implementation tasks (5 tasks)
  - Real-time features → WebSocket implementation tasks (4 tasks)
  - Search & performance → Optimization tasks (3 tasks)

**Ordering Strategy (TDD Compliance)**:
1. **Contract Tests First**: API contract tests for all endpoints [P] (Tasks 1-18)
2. **Data Layer**: Entity models and repositories [P] (Tasks 19-28)
3. **Service Layer Tests**: Business logic integration tests (Tasks 29-35)
4. **Service Implementation**: Make service tests pass (Tasks 36-42)
5. **API Integration Tests**: End-to-end API testing (Tasks 43-49)
6. **API Implementation**: Make API tests pass (Tasks 50-56)
7. **Frontend Component Tests**: UI component unit tests [P] (Tasks 57-71)
8. **Frontend Implementation**: Make UI tests pass (Tasks 72-86)
9. **E2E Tests**: User journey validation with Playwright (Tasks 87-93)
10. **Performance & Optimization**: Load testing and optimization (Tasks 94-96)

**Dependencies & Parallelization**:
- Contract tests [P] can run in parallel (Tasks 1-18)
- Entity models [P] can be developed in parallel (Tasks 19-28)
- Frontend components [P] independent of backend (Tasks 57-71)
- Service tests depend on entity models (Tasks 29+ depend on 19-28)
- API implementation depends on service layer (Tasks 50+ depend on 36-42)
- E2E tests depend on full stack completion (Tasks 87+ depend on all previous)

**Constitutional Compliance Enforcement**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle: Every test task must fail before implementation task
- Real dependencies: Testcontainers for database, actual WebSocket connections
- Library-first: Each major component becomes reusable library with CLI
- Observability: Structured logging and metrics in all implementation tasks

**Estimated Output**: 96 numbered, dependency-ordered tasks in tasks.md
- 40% Test tasks (contract, integration, unit, E2E)
- 35% Implementation tasks (backend services, frontend components)
- 15% Infrastructure tasks (auth, real-time, search)
- 10% Validation tasks (performance, security, mobile)

**Quality Gates**:
- No implementation task without corresponding failing test
- All contract tests pass before service development
- Integration tests validate quickstart scenarios
- E2E tests cover all 7 user scenarios from quickstart guide
- Performance tests validate <2s dashboard, <200ms API, <1s real-time targets

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
