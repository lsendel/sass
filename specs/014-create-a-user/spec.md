# Feature Specification: User-Facing Audit Log Viewer

**Feature Branch**: `014-create-a-user`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a User-Facing Audit Log Viewer"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a platform user, I want to view and search through audit logs related to my account and organization so that I can track what actions have been performed, investigate security incidents, and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am logged into the platform, **When** I navigate to the audit log viewer, **Then** I should see a chronological list of audit events related to my permissions scope
2. **Given** I am viewing audit logs, **When** I filter by date range, **Then** the system should display only events within the specified timeframe
3. **Given** I am viewing audit logs, **When** I search for specific actions or entities, **Then** the system should highlight matching results and allow me to navigate through them
4. **Given** I have appropriate permissions, **When** I export audit logs, **Then** the system should generate a downloadable report in the requested format
5. **Given** I am viewing an audit log entry, **When** I click on it for details, **Then** the system should display comprehensive information about the event including timestamp, actor, action, and affected resources

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no audit logs exist for the selected criteria?
- How does the system handle viewing logs when user permissions change during the session?
- What occurs when trying to access audit logs for deleted or archived resources?
- How does the system behave when export requests exceed size limits?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display audit log entries that the current user has permission to view based on their role and organizational access
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to filter audit logs by date range, with default showing last 30 days
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide search functionality across audit log fields including actions, actors, and affected resources
- **FR-004**: System MUST display audit log entries in reverse chronological order (newest first) with pagination
- **FR-005**: System MUST show essential audit information including timestamp, user/actor, action performed, and target resource
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to view detailed information for individual audit log entries
- **FR-007**: System MUST support exporting filtered audit logs to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: export formats not specified - CSV, PDF, JSON?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST enforce access controls ensuring users only see audit logs they're authorized to view [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific authorization rules not defined]
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle empty result sets gracefully with appropriate messaging
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide loading indicators during search and filter operations
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain audit log viewer state when users navigate away and return [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: session duration and persistence rules not specified]
- **FR-012**: System MUST display audit events in user's local timezone [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: timezone handling preferences not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Audit Log Entry**: Represents a single auditable action with timestamp, actor, action type, target resource, outcome, and additional metadata
- **User Permission Scope**: Defines what audit logs a user can access based on their role, organization membership, and resource permissions
- **Filter Criteria**: User-defined parameters for narrowing audit log display including date ranges, search terms, and action types
- **Export Request**: Request for generating downloadable audit log reports with specified format and filtered content
