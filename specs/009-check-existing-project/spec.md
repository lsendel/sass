# Feature Specification: Alternative Password Authentication

**Feature Branch**: `009-check-existing-project`
**Created**: 2025-09-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "check existing project and add login password, Analyze the existing project structure first to understand: Current authentication method (OAuth) Project standards and conventions Existing test suite structure. Implement a login/password authentication feature that: Only activates when an environment flag is enabled Uses .env file (or project's standard config method) for the feature flag Example: ENABLE_PASSWORD_AUTH=true When flag is false or missing, keep only OAuth authentication When flag is true, show login/password option alongside OAuth. Configuration approach: Follow the project's existing configuration patterns If no clear pattern exists, suggest best practice for this project type. Testing requirements: Update all affected unit tests Add new tests for the conditional authentication logic Ensure all existing tests remain passing Follow project's testing conventions investigate first what are the best practices for the algorithm etc"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the platform, I want to be able to authenticate using a username and password when this option is enabled, providing an alternative to OAuth authentication while maintaining the existing OAuth functionality when password authentication is disabled.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the password authentication flag is disabled or missing, **When** a user accesses the login page, **Then** only the OAuth authentication option is displayed
2. **Given** the password authentication flag is enabled, **When** a user accesses the login page, **Then** both OAuth and username/password authentication options are displayed
3. **Given** password authentication is enabled and a user has valid credentials, **When** they submit their username and password, **Then** they are successfully authenticated and granted access to the system
4. **Given** password authentication is enabled and a user has invalid credentials, **When** they submit their username and password, **Then** they receive an appropriate error message and are not granted access
5. **Given** a user is authenticated via password, **When** they log out, **Then** their session is properly terminated and they must re-authenticate to access protected resources
6. **Given** password authentication is enabled, **When** a user chooses OAuth instead, **Then** the existing OAuth flow continues to work as before

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the configuration flag is changed while users are logged in? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should existing sessions remain valid or be terminated?]
- How does the system handle password reset when password auth is enabled? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is password reset/recovery functionality required?]
- What happens if a user has both OAuth and password accounts? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should accounts be linked or separate?]
- How are brute force attempts prevented? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What rate limiting or account lockout policies should be implemented?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST check for an environment configuration flag to determine if password authentication is enabled
- **FR-002**: System MUST display only OAuth authentication when the password authentication flag is false, missing, or invalid
- **FR-003**: System MUST display both OAuth and password authentication options when the flag is explicitly set to true
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate username and password credentials against stored user accounts when password authentication is used
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain existing OAuth authentication functionality regardless of password authentication setting
- **FR-006**: System MUST securely store password credentials using [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific hashing algorithm not specified - bcrypt, argon2, PBKDF2?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST enforce password complexity requirements of [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: minimum length, special characters, uppercase/lowercase requirements not specified]
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle concurrent authentication methods without conflict (users can choose either method when both are available)
- **FR-009**: System MUST properly terminate sessions initiated via password authentication upon logout
- **FR-010**: System MUST log authentication attempts for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: audit requirements not specified - success only, failures, or both?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle account lockout after [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: number of failed attempts and lockout duration not specified]
- **FR-012**: Users MUST be able to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: create new password-based accounts or only use existing accounts?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Account**: Represents a user in the system with authentication credentials, may have OAuth credentials, password credentials, or both
- **Authentication Method**: The type of authentication used (OAuth or Password) for a specific session
- **User Session**: An active authenticated session with associated authentication method and expiration
- **Configuration Setting**: Environment-based setting that controls feature availability (password authentication enable/disable flag)
