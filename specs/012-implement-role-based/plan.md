# Implementation Plan: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Organizations


**Branch**: `012-implement-role-based` | **Date**: 2025-09-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/012-implement-role-based/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Implement comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for organizations enabling administrators to create custom roles with specific permissions, assign roles to users, and enforce permission checks throughout the platform. The system will support hierarchical permissions, real-time permission updates, comprehensive audit logging, and multi-tenant organization isolation.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Java 21 with Spring Boot 3.5.6
**Primary Dependencies**: Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, Spring Modulith 1.4.3, PostgreSQL
**Storage**: PostgreSQL for persistence, Redis for session management
**Testing**: JUnit 5 with TestContainers, ArchUnit for architecture testing
**Target Platform**: Linux server deployment (Spring Boot application)
**Project Type**: web - Spring Boot Modulith backend + React TypeScript frontend
**Performance Goals**: <200ms response time for permission checks, 1000+ concurrent users
**Constraints**: PCI DSS compliance, GDPR compliance, module boundary enforcement
**Scale/Scope**: Multi-tenant organizations, role hierarchy support, fine-grained permissions

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 2 (backend Spring Boot Modulith, frontend React) - within limit
- Using framework directly? YES (Spring Security, Spring Data JPA)
- Single data model? YES (JPA entities, no unnecessary DTOs)
- Avoiding patterns? YES (using Spring Data repositories directly, no custom abstractions)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? YES (Spring Modulith modules: user, auth, shared)
- Libraries listed: user-module (RBAC entities), auth-module (permission enforcement), shared-module (common types)
- CLI per library: N/A (web application, not CLI tool)
- Library docs: Using Spring Boot Actuator endpoints for module documentation

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? YES (tests written first, must fail initially)
- Git commits show tests before implementation? YES (commit strategy enforced)
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? YES
- Real dependencies used? YES (TestContainers with PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Integration tests for: YES (RBAC module boundaries, permission contract changes)
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase - STRICTLY ENFORCED

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? YES (SLF4J with logback, audit module integration)
- Frontend logs → backend? YES (error reporting to audit module)
- Error context sufficient? YES (correlation IDs, security event logging)

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? YES (1.1.0 - minor feature addition to existing platform)
- BUILD increments on every change? YES (automated via CI/CD)
- Breaking changes handled? YES (database migrations, backward compatibility for existing permissions)

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - backend/ and frontend/ structure detected

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (data-model.md, rbac-api.yaml, quickstart.md)
- RBAC API contract → contract test tasks [P] for all 8 endpoints
- 4 core entities (Role, Permission, RolePermission, UserOrganizationRole) → JPA entity creation tasks [P]
- 5 user stories from quickstart → integration test tasks
- Service implementation tasks for RoleService, PermissionService, RbacSecurityService
- Spring Security integration tasks for @PreAuthorize annotations
- Cache implementation tasks for Redis-based permission caching
- Frontend tasks for role management UI components

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests → Integration tests → Entity tests → Implementation
- Dependency order: Entities → Repositories → Services → Controllers → Security → UI
- Database migration before entity creation
- Cache configuration before service implementation
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent modules/components)

**Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Database Tasks** (3-4 tasks): Migration scripts, indexes, constraints
2. **Entity Tasks** (4 tasks): JPA entities with validation and relationships [P]
3. **Repository Tasks** (4 tasks): Spring Data repositories with custom queries [P]
4. **Contract Tests** (8 tasks): API endpoint contract validation [P]
5. **Service Tasks** (6 tasks): Business logic implementation with caching
6. **Security Tasks** (4 tasks): Spring Security integration and @PreAuthorize
7. **Integration Tests** (5 tasks): End-to-end RBAC flow testing
8. **Frontend Tasks** (6 tasks): React components for role management UI
9. **Performance Tasks** (2 tasks): Load testing and cache optimization

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
