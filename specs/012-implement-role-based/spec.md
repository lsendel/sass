# Feature Specification: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Organizations

**Feature Branch**: `012-implement-role-based`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Organizations."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Organization administrators need to control which users can access specific resources and perform certain actions within their organization. They should be able to assign roles to users that automatically grant appropriate permissions, ensuring security while maintaining operational efficiency.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an organization admin is logged in, **When** they create a new role with specific permissions, **Then** the role is saved and available for assignment to users
2. **Given** a user has been assigned a role, **When** they attempt to access a resource covered by their role permissions, **Then** they are granted access
3. **Given** a user attempts to access a resource, **When** they don't have the required permissions, **Then** access is denied with appropriate feedback
4. **Given** an admin wants to modify user access, **When** they change a user's role assignment, **Then** the user's permissions update immediately
5. **Given** multiple users have the same role, **When** the role permissions are updated, **Then** all users with that role receive the updated permissions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user's role is deleted while they're actively using the system?
- How does the system handle permission conflicts when a user has multiple roles?
- What occurs when an organization admin tries to remove their own admin privileges?
- How are permissions handled for users who belong to multiple organizations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow organization administrators to create custom roles with specific permission sets
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow administrators to assign and remove roles from organization users
- **FR-003**: System MUST enforce permission checks before granting access to any protected resource or action
- **FR-004**: System MUST support hierarchical permissions where higher-level roles include lower-level permissions
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a way to view all permissions associated with a specific role
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow administrators to view all roles assigned to a specific user
- **FR-007**: System MUST log all role and permission changes for audit purposes
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent users from escalating their own privileges
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure that permission changes take effect immediately for active user sessions
- **FR-010**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: granularity level of permissions - resource-level, action-level, or both?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle users who belong to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: single organization only, or multiple organizations?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST define [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what are the default/predefined roles like Admin, Member, etc.?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST specify [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum number of roles per user and roles per organization?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what happens to user access when they leave an organization?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Role**: Represents a collection of permissions that can be assigned to users, includes name, description, and permission set
- **Permission**: Represents a specific action or access right that can be granted, includes resource type and action type
- **User**: Organization member who can be assigned roles, maintains relationship to organization and role assignments
- **Organization**: Container for users and roles, defines the boundary for RBAC scope
- **Role Assignment**: Links users to roles within an organization context, includes assignment date and assigned by information
