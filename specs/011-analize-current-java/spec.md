**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Draft

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Analyze current Java API structure
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: API endpoints, testing requirements, automation needs
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with clarifications for testing scope
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Create comprehensive test workflow
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement focused on test coverage and automation
6. Identify Key Entities (testing components)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Validate complete test coverage plan
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT needs to be tested and WHY
-  Clear test progression and status visibility
-  Comprehensive coverage of all API endpoints
-  Easy-to-understand test execution flow
- L Avoid implementation specifics until planning phase

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a QA engineer, I need a comprehensive integration testing framework for the Java API that provides clear visibility into test coverage, execution progress, and results, so that I can ensure all API endpoints are properly validated and functioning correctly.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new API endpoint is developed, **When** the test suite runs, **Then** it automatically validates all contract requirements, security controls, and business logic
2. **Given** the CI/CD pipeline triggers, **When** integration tests execute, **Then** clear test progress indicators show which API modules are being tested
3. **Given** a test failure occurs, **When** reviewing results, **Then** detailed error messages and request/response payloads are available for debugging
4. **Given** multiple test environments exist, **When** switching between them, **Then** tests automatically adjust configuration without code changes
5. **Given** performance requirements exist, **When** tests run, **Then** response time metrics are captured and validated against SLAs

### Edge Cases
- What happens when external dependencies (Stripe, OAuth providers) are unavailable?
- How does the system handle concurrent test execution across modules?
- How are flaky tests identified and managed?
- What happens when database state conflicts between parallel tests?
- How does the framework handle rate-limited endpoints during testing?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Test Coverage Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide complete integration test coverage for all 6 API modules (auth, payment, subscription, user, audit, shared)
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate all documented API endpoints including success paths, error conditions, and edge cases
- **FR-003**: Tests MUST verify module boundary compliance and event-driven communication patterns
- **FR-004**: System MUST execute contract validation for all API requests and responses against OpenAPI specifications
- **FR-005**: Tests MUST validate security requirements including authentication, authorization, and tenant isolation

#### Test Execution & Orchestration
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear visual progress indicators showing current test phase (Setup ’ Module Testing ’ Integration ’ Cleanup)
- **FR-007**: System MUST support parallel test execution while maintaining data isolation between tests
- **FR-008**: Framework MUST provide test categorization by priority (Critical ’ Major ’ Minor) with selective execution capability
- **FR-009**: System MUST support multiple test environments with environment-specific configuration management
- **FR-010**: Tests MUST be executable both locally and in CI/CD pipelines with consistent results

#### Test Data Management
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide test data generation for all entity types with realistic values
- **FR-012**: Framework MUST support database state management with automatic rollback after each test
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle external service mocking for Stripe, OAuth, and email services
- **FR-014**: Tests MUST validate data persistence and retrieval across module boundaries
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide fixture management for common test scenarios

#### Reporting & Visibility
- **FR-016**: System MUST generate comprehensive test reports showing pass/fail status per module and endpoint
- **FR-017**: Reports MUST include test execution timeline with clear phase indicators
- **FR-018**: System MUST capture and display request/response payloads for failed tests
- **FR-019**: Framework MUST track test execution metrics including duration, flakiness, and success rates
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide coverage reports mapping tests to API endpoints and business requirements

#### Error Handling & Recovery
- **FR-021**: System MUST implement automatic retry logic for transient failures with configurable thresholds
- **FR-022**: Framework MUST isolate test failures to prevent cascade effects on other tests
- **FR-023**: System MUST provide detailed error diagnostics including stack traces and contextual information
- **FR-024**: Tests MUST validate all error response formats and HTTP status codes
- **FR-025**: System MUST handle timeout scenarios gracefully with proper cleanup

### Key Entities

- **Test Suite**: Represents a collection of related tests for a specific module or feature area
- **Test Scenario**: Individual test case with setup, execution, and validation phases
- **Test Environment**: Configuration profile for different deployment targets (local, staging, production)
- **Test Report**: Comprehensive results including metrics, failures, and coverage analysis
- **Test Fixture**: Reusable test data and mock configurations
- **API Endpoint**: Specific REST endpoint being tested with its contract requirements
- **Test Phase**: Distinct stage in test execution (Setup, Authentication, Module Test, Integration, Cleanup)

## Test Execution Flow Architecture

### Phase 1: Environment Setup
- Database initialization with test schemas
- Redis cache setup for session management
- Mock service configuration (Stripe, OAuth)
- Test data seed preparation

### Phase 2: Module-Level Testing (Isolated)
- **Auth Module**: Login flows, OAuth2/PKCE, session management, password policies
- **User Module**: Organization CRUD, user management, multi-tenancy validation
- **Payment Module**: Stripe integration, webhook processing, payment intents
- **Subscription Module**: Plan management, billing cycles, subscription states
- **Audit Module**: Event logging, GDPR compliance, retention policies

### Phase 3: Cross-Module Integration
- User registration triggering organization creation
- Payment processing updating subscription status
- Authentication events generating audit logs
- Subscription changes publishing domain events

### Phase 4: End-to-End Scenarios
- Complete user journey from registration to payment
- Organization onboarding with subscription selection
- Payment failure and recovery workflows
- Security incident response flows

### Phase 5: Performance & Load Testing
- API endpoint response time validation
- Concurrent user simulation
- Database query performance
- Cache effectiveness measurement
