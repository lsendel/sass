# Feature Specification: In-App Notification System

**Feature Branch**: `013-develop-an-in`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Develop an In-App Notification System"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a platform user, I need to receive timely, relevant notifications within the application so I can stay informed about important events, updates, and actions that require my attention without missing critical information.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is logged into the platform, **When** a relevant event occurs (payment processed, subscription expiring, security alert), **Then** they receive an in-app notification displayed prominently in the interface
2. **Given** a user has unread notifications, **When** they navigate to any page in the application, **Then** they see a notification indicator showing the count of unread messages
3. **Given** a user clicks on a notification, **When** the notification is actionable, **Then** they are directed to the relevant page or modal to complete the required action
4. **Given** a user wants to review past notifications, **When** they access the notification center, **Then** they can view all notifications with timestamps and filter by type or status
5. **Given** a user receives multiple notifications, **When** they mark notifications as read, **Then** the unread count updates accordingly
6. **Given** a user wants to control their notification experience, **When** they access notification preferences, **Then** they can enable/disable specific notification types

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user receives notifications while offline and comes back online?
- How does the system handle notification delivery when multiple browser tabs are open?
- What occurs when the notification storage reaches capacity limits?
- How are notifications handled for users with different role permissions?
- What happens if a notification references data that has been deleted?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display notifications to users within the application interface in real-time
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a notification center where users can view all notifications (read and unread)
- **FR-003**: System MUST show an unread notification count indicator visible across all application pages
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to mark individual notifications as read or unread
- **FR-005**: System MUST support different notification types (info, warning, error, success, action required)
- **FR-006**: System MUST include timestamps for all notifications showing when they were created
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to delete notifications they no longer need
- **FR-008**: System MUST support actionable notifications that direct users to relevant pages or actions
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide notification preferences allowing users to control which types they receive
- **FR-010**: System MUST persist notifications across user sessions and device changes
- **FR-011**: System MUST automatically expire notifications after [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified - 30 days, 90 days, 1 year?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: delivery method not specified - real-time push, polling, websockets?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST limit notification storage per user to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: storage limit not specified - number of notifications or data size?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST support role-based notification targeting for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: user roles not specified - admin, subscriber, guest?]
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle notification delivery for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: multi-tenancy requirements not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Notification**: Represents a message sent to users, containing title, content, type, timestamp, read status, and optional action metadata
- **NotificationPreference**: User-specific settings controlling which notification types they want to receive
- **NotificationTemplate**: Predefined message templates for different event types within the platform
- **NotificationRecipient**: Links between notifications and target users, tracking delivery and read status
