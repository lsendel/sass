# Security Observability Dashboard Research

## Research Findings

### Real-time Security Monitoring Architecture
**Decision**: WebSocket-based real-time updates with Server-Sent Events (SSE) fallback
**Rationale**:
- WebSockets provide low-latency bidirectional communication for real-time security alerts
- SSE fallback ensures compatibility with corporate firewalls and proxy configurations
- Spring Boot WebSocket support integrates well with existing security context
**Alternatives considered**:
- Polling: Higher latency, increased server load
- Long polling: Resource intensive, connection management complexity

### Security Event Storage Strategy
**Decision**: Hybrid approach with PostgreSQL + time-series database (InfluxDB)
**Rationale**:
- PostgreSQL for structured security metadata, user permissions, dashboard configurations
- InfluxDB for high-frequency time-series security metrics and events
- Enables both complex queries and high-performance time-series analysis
**Alternatives considered**:
- PostgreSQL only: Limited time-series performance at scale
- ElasticSearch: Operational complexity, resource overhead
- Prometheus: Not suitable for complex security event metadata

### Dashboard Visualization Technology
**Decision**: React with D3.js for custom security visualizations + Chart.js for standard metrics
**Rationale**:
- D3.js provides maximum flexibility for custom security threat visualization patterns
- Chart.js handles standard dashboards (line charts, bars) with less complexity
- React context for real-time data binding and state management
**Alternatives considered**:
- Pure D3.js: Steeper learning curve, more development overhead
- Recharts: Limited customization for security-specific visualizations
- Canvas-based solutions: Accessibility concerns, complexity

### Security Event Collection Patterns
**Decision**: Micrometer with custom security metrics + Spring Security events
**Rationale**:
- Micrometer integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot observability stack
- Custom metrics for security-specific events (login attempts, permission checks)
- Spring Security event publishers provide authentication/authorization monitoring
**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom event system: Reinventing existing observability infrastructure
- AOP-based monitoring: Performance overhead, complexity
- External APM tools: Vendor lock-in, cost implications

### Alert and Notification System
**Decision**: Spring Events with async processing + webhook integration
**Rationale**:
- Spring Events provide loose coupling between monitoring and alerting
- Async processing prevents alert processing from blocking main security flows
- Webhook integration allows external SIEM/SOC tool integration
**Alternatives considered**:
- Message queues (RabbitMQ): Additional infrastructure complexity
- Email-only alerts: Limited integration capabilities
- Push notifications: Requires mobile app development

### Compliance and Audit Integration
**Decision**: Structured logging with correlation IDs + audit event streams
**Rationale**:
- Correlation IDs enable tracing security events across microservices
- Structured JSON logging enables automated compliance reporting
- Audit event streams support real-time compliance monitoring
**Alternatives considered**:
- Database-only audit logs: Limited real-time capabilities
- File-based logging: Difficult to query and analyze
- External audit systems: Integration complexity

### Performance and Scalability Considerations
**Decision**: Connection pooling + caching layer + data aggregation
**Rationale**:
- Connection pooling handles high-frequency security event ingestion
- Redis caching for frequently accessed dashboard data
- Pre-aggregated metrics reduce real-time computation load
**Alternatives considered**:
- No caching: Poor dashboard performance under load
- Database-only aggregation: Performance bottleneck
- Client-side aggregation: Security risk, limited scalability

### Security Dashboard Authentication
**Decision**: OAuth2/OIDC integration with role-based dashboard access
**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing Spring Security OAuth2 implementation
- Role-based access controls who can view which security metrics
- OIDC provides standardized identity integration
**Alternatives considered**:
- Basic authentication: Insufficient for enterprise security requirements
- Custom auth system: Security risk, maintenance overhead
- API key only: No user-level access controls

## Implementation Dependencies

### Backend Libraries
- Spring Boot WebSocket: Real-time communication
- Micrometer: Metrics collection and export
- Spring Security Events: Authentication/authorization monitoring
- InfluxDB client: Time-series data operations
- Redis: Caching and session management

### Frontend Libraries
- Socket.io-client: WebSocket communication
- D3.js: Custom security visualizations
- Chart.js: Standard dashboard charts
- React Context API: State management
- Axios: HTTP client for API communication

### Infrastructure Requirements
- InfluxDB: Time-series database for metrics
- Redis: Caching and real-time data
- Nginx: WebSocket proxy and load balancing

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive security metrics
- Role-based access to different security data views
- Audit logging for dashboard access and configuration changes

### Performance Constraints
- Dashboard load time: <200ms initial render
- Real-time update latency: <1 second for critical alerts
- Concurrent user support: 100+ simultaneous dashboard users
- Data retention: 90 days for detailed events, 1 year for aggregated metrics

## Integration Points

### Existing Platform Integration
- Spring Modulith security events from auth, payment, subscription modules
- Existing PostgreSQL database for user permissions and configuration
- Current observability stack (Micrometer, logging infrastructure)

### External System Integration
- SIEM systems via webhook APIs
- Alert management systems (PagerDuty, Slack)
- Compliance reporting systems
- Identity providers (LDAP, Active Directory)
