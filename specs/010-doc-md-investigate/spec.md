# Feature Specification: Comprehensive Project Documentation System

**Feature Branch**: `010-doc-md-investigate`
**Created**: 2025-01-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "@doc.md investigate and do best practices for project documentation , compleate the documentation including archiecture , design , investigate is a tool like docusarius 2 is good for each of the subpeoject"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Identified: documentation system, architecture docs, design docs, tool evaluation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: developers, architects, new team members, stakeholders
   ’ Actions: read docs, contribute docs, search docs, navigate docs
   ’ Data: markdown files, diagrams, API specs, architecture decisions
   ’ Constraints: multi-project structure, consistency, maintainability
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Documentation scope boundaries marked
   ’ Tool selection criteria marked
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User flows defined for documentation consumers and contributors
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement made testable
   ’ Documentation completeness requirements defined
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Documentation artifacts and their relationships defined
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN: Some clarifications needed on tool deployment strategy
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a new developer joining the project, I need to quickly understand the system architecture, design patterns, and how to contribute to different subprojects, so that I can become productive within my first week. The documentation should provide clear navigation, comprehensive coverage of all system components, and be searchable and maintainable.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new developer accessing the documentation, **When** they search for architecture information, **Then** they find comprehensive system architecture diagrams and explanations within 30 seconds
2. **Given** a developer wanting to understand a specific subproject, **When** they navigate to that project's documentation, **Then** they find project-specific guides including setup, development workflows, and design patterns
3. **Given** an architect documenting a design decision, **When** they contribute new documentation, **Then** the documentation follows consistent templates and is automatically indexed for search
4. **Given** a stakeholder reviewing project status, **When** they access high-level documentation, **Then** they find executive summaries without technical implementation details
5. **Given** a developer updating existing documentation, **When** they make changes, **Then** the documentation system validates completeness and consistency

### Edge Cases
- What happens when documentation references outdated or deprecated components?
- How does system handle conflicting information across different documentation sections?
- What happens when documentation search returns too many or no results?
- How does system ensure documentation stays synchronized with code changes?
- What happens when multiple developers edit the same documentation simultaneously?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide comprehensive documentation for overall system architecture including component relationships and data flow
- **FR-002**: System MUST document design patterns and decisions with rationale and trade-offs
- **FR-003**: Each subproject MUST have dedicated documentation section with project-specific information
- **FR-004**: Documentation MUST be searchable across all projects and sections
- **FR-005**: System MUST support versioned documentation aligned with software releases
- **FR-006**: Documentation MUST include getting-started guides for new developers
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide API documentation for all public interfaces
- **FR-008**: Documentation MUST support diagrams, code examples, and multimedia content
- **FR-009**: System MUST evaluate and recommend appropriate documentation tools (e.g., Docusaurus 2) based on [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: evaluation criteria - cost, features, maintenance burden?]
- **FR-010**: Documentation MUST be accessible via web browser without authentication for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: public documentation scope - all docs or subset?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST support contribution workflows for documentation updates
- **FR-012**: Documentation MUST include deployment and operations guides
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide documentation templates for consistency
- **FR-014**: Documentation MUST track and display last-updated timestamps
- **FR-015**: System MUST support cross-referencing between documentation sections
- **FR-016**: Documentation MUST be deployable as [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: deployment target - static site, internal portal, multiple formats?]
- **FR-017**: System MUST validate documentation completeness for required sections
- **FR-018**: Documentation MUST support multiple audiences (developers, operators, business stakeholders)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Documentation Page**: Represents individual documentation content with title, content, metadata, and relationships to other pages
- **Project Documentation**: Collection of documentation specific to a subproject including README, guides, and API docs
- **Architecture Document**: High-level system design documentation with diagrams and decision records
- **Design Pattern**: Reusable solution documentation with examples and use cases
- **Documentation Version**: Point-in-time snapshot of documentation aligned with software version
- **Search Index**: Searchable catalog of all documentation content with relevance scoring
- **Documentation Template**: Standardized structure for consistent documentation creation
- **Contributor Guide**: Documentation about how to contribute to documentation

## Additional Considerations

### Documentation Coverage Areas
The comprehensive documentation system should address:
- System architecture and high-level design
- Individual subproject documentation (frontend, backend, infrastructure)
- API documentation and integration guides
- Development workflows and best practices
- Deployment and operations procedures
- Security and compliance documentation
- Performance tuning and monitoring guides
- Troubleshooting and FAQ sections

### Tool Evaluation Criteria
When investigating documentation tools like Docusaurus 2:
- Multi-project support capabilities
- Search functionality and performance
- Version control integration
- Customization and theming options
- Build and deployment complexity
- Community support and maintenance
- Cost considerations
- Migration path from existing documentation

### Documentation Best Practices to Implement
- Keep documentation close to code
- Automate documentation generation where possible
- Regular documentation reviews and updates
- Clear ownership and maintenance responsibilities
- Documentation testing and validation
- Accessibility compliance
- Internationalization support if needed
