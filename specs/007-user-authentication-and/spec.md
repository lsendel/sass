# Feature Specification: User Authentication and Login System with OAuth2 Providers

**Feature Branch**: `007-user-authentication-and`
**Created**: 2025-01-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "User authentication and login system with OAuth2 providers"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Parsed: OAuth2-based authentication system
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Users, OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Microsoft)
   ’ Actions: Login, logout, token management, authorization
   ’ Data: User profiles, OAuth tokens, session management
   ’ Constraints: OAuth2/PKCE flow, security requirements
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Token storage duration and refresh policies]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: User profile data synchronization frequency]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary flow: OAuth provider selection ’ authorization ’ callback ’ authenticated session
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
6. Identify Key Entities (OAuth providers, users, sessions)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Some uncertainties marked for clarification
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A business user needs to securely access the payment platform using their existing accounts from trusted providers (Google, GitHub, or Microsoft) without creating and managing another username/password combination. The system should provide a seamless login experience while maintaining high security standards and compliance requirements.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the login page, **When** they click on a preferred OAuth provider (Google/GitHub/Microsoft), **Then** they are redirected to the provider's authorization page
2. **Given** a user successfully authorizes the application on the OAuth provider, **When** they are redirected back to the platform, **Then** they are automatically logged in with their profile information populated
3. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** their session expires, **Then** they are prompted to re-authenticate through their chosen OAuth provider
4. **Given** a user who previously logged in, **When** they return to the platform, **Then** they can choose the same or different OAuth provider for authentication
5. **Given** a user completes OAuth flow, **When** the provider returns user information, **Then** their profile is created or updated with the latest information from the provider

### Edge Cases
- What happens when OAuth provider is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system handle when a user's email changes on the OAuth provider?
- What occurs if OAuth authorization is denied or cancelled by the user?
- How does the system handle OAuth provider returning incomplete user information?
- What happens when the same email exists across multiple OAuth providers?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support OAuth2/PKCE authentication flow for secure authorization
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide login options for Google, GitHub, and Microsoft OAuth providers
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to authenticate without creating platform-specific credentials
- **FR-004**: System MUST create user profiles automatically upon successful OAuth authentication
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain secure session management with appropriate timeout policies
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle OAuth callback processing and error scenarios gracefully
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide logout functionality that terminates both platform and OAuth provider sessions
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate OAuth tokens and refresh them when necessary
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to link multiple OAuth providers to the same account [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: account linking strategy not specified]
- **FR-010**: System MUST store minimal user information required for platform operation
- **FR-011**: System MUST redirect users to intended destination after successful authentication
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide clear error messages for authentication failures
- **FR-013**: System MUST log all authentication events for security audit purposes
- **FR-014**: System MUST enforce session timeout policies [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific timeout duration not specified]
- **FR-015**: System MUST support user profile updates from OAuth provider data [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: synchronization frequency not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents a platform user with basic profile information (name, email, provider ID), authentication history, and account status
- **OAuth Provider**: Represents external authentication services (Google, GitHub, Microsoft) with configuration details and availability status
- **Authentication Session**: Represents active user sessions with creation time, expiration, and associated OAuth tokens
- **OAuth Token**: Represents access and refresh tokens from providers with expiration times and scope information
- **Authentication Event**: Represents audit log entries for login attempts, successes, failures, and logouts
