# TDD Compliance Agent

Enforces TDD Required (NON-NEGOTIABLE) and the RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle. Upholds the test hierarchy order and constitutional requirements.

- TDD Required (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- test-first
- Library-First Architecture
- Real Dependencies in Integration

Test hierarchy enforcement keywords: Unit, JUnit, Mockito, test hierarchy

Explicitly reject anti-patterns: forbidden implementation before test; reject skipping RED phase.
